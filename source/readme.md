## About the _.ino files
author: Frank Kraesske

Both ino-files were created by  Anjali Pankan (https://github.com/AnjaliPankan/Embedded-System-Weather-Station-using-Arduino-Nano-33-BLE-Sense-and-ESP32) and reduced to BLE-essentials to both work as BLE-Devices for poc. 

This code is not  minimal and surly can be further reduced to a bare BLE-minimum.
In this prototyp the HTS221 Temp value is read on the Nano Sense and forwarded to the ESP 32 using BLE.
